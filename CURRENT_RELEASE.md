# Current release baseline

Updated: 2026-09-15 KST

## Android 0.9.0 / code 25

Implemented:

- Persistent user opt-in for PTT readiness
- Best-effort sticky foreground service recreation without automatic recording
- Explicit stop disables restoration even when the service instance is absent
- System-bar inset handling for native scrolling screens
- Existing reminder, Calendar, sync, DB, WAV, and approval boundaries retained

Verified:

- Android host wiring: 45 cases / 376 assertions
- PTT lifecycle harness: 39 assertions
- System-bar inset harness: 28 assertions
- Manual Java/D8/APK pipeline and same-signature update were previously exercised with the private toolchain
- Galaxy S25 screen-off physical-button recording passed in the verified environment
- Installed operational APK SHA-256: `488e687dd9c6ec3f536a1d18e2876ef39e539913190456a8dfce864158b72025`
- Public-placeholder source rebuilt successfully on 2026-09-15; its local verification APK SHA-256 was `92135cb75de8f2e35799c226edc2915d4caa0b4285a56a22709663de30b9132f` and is not an install/update deliverable

Not guaranteed or still separate:

- Reboot and force-stop automatic microphone foreground-service recovery
- Natural long-duration Doze and OEM process reclaim
- Actual sound, vibration, and heads-up observation
- Posted-notification cleanup through a currently reachable UI path
